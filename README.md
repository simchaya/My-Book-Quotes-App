## 💡 How it works

1. **Snap your book cover** → App automatically fills in title, author, and finds the cover image
2. **Capture a quote** → Point your camera at the page, text appears instantly
3. **Add your thought** → Write why this quote matters to you (optional but powerful)
4. **Read more intentionally** → Knowing you can save great moments makes you notice them more

Your personal library grows with every book you love.

## 📝 Technical note

The camera features use Google Cloud Vision API for text recognition (OCR). The app connects to a cloud function to process images and extract text.

If you're running your own instance, you'll need to set up the Google Cloud Vision endpoint (see `/cloud-function/` folder). Otherwise, you can type quotes manually.

## 🎯 Why I built this

I kept losing the quotes that made me stop and think. But more than that, I noticed something: when I knew I'd capture a great quote, I read more intentionally. I paid closer attention.

MarkItDown is designed to make reading more rewarding. The act of capturing a quote—snapping a photo, adding your thought about why it matters—makes you engage deeper with what you're reading.

It's not just about saving quotes. It's about reading better.
