# üìö Welcome to my Book Quotes app

A simple React Native + Expo app for iOS that lets you log your favorite books and quotes.
Built with a focus on simplicity, modularity, and a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Core**
  - Add books with multiple quotes
  - Prevent duplicate book entries (quotes grouped by book)
  - Local persistence with AsyncStorage
  - Custom ‚ÄúNot Found‚Äù screen
  - Swipe-to-delete books (iOS-style gesture)

- **UI/UX**
  - Apple HIG‚Äìinspired design
  - Dark/light mode support
  - Design system (`theme.ts` for typography, colors, spacing)
  - Consistent 8pt spacing rhythm

## New in this version
- Take book cover photos with device camera  
- Covers now display with saved books  
- Full-screen scroll (inputs + quotes)  
- KeyboardAvoidingView on iOS (inputs move above keyboard)
- Swipe-to-delete for books (HIG-aligned interaction)

 ## Planned Enhancements
- CRUD: edit/remove books & quotes  
- Cloud sync (MongoDB + login)  
- OCR & search across books  
- Highlighting + improved layouts 
- Discover quotes
