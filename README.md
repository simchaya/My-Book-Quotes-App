# ðŸ“š Welcome to my Book Quotes app

A simple React Native + Expo app for iOS that lets you log your favorite books and quotes.
Built with a focus on simplicity, modularity, and a user-friendly interface.

## Current Features (MVP)

- Add books with multiple quotes
- Prevent duplicate book entries (quotes are grouped by book)
- Automatic saving with AsyncStorage (local device storage)
- Custom Not Found screen with Safe Area support
- iOS dark/light mode support
- Organized project structure with Expo Router

### UI/UX

- Adopted Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for a cleaner, native iOS feel  
- Introduced a design system (`theme.ts`) with typography, colors, and spacing  
- Updated **About page** with step-by-step instructions and inspirational vision  
- Consistent spacing system applied across screens (8pt rhythm)  

## Local Persistence

Right now, data is stored **locally on the device** with [AsyncStorage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage).

 - **Helpers**:  
   - `utils/async-storage.ts` â†’ `storeObject` / `getObject` helpers  
   - `utils/id.ts` â†’ `uniqueId()` helper  
 - **Hook**:  
   - `hooks/useBookQuotes.ts` â†’ Manages books/quotes, loads/saves data

 This means your books and quotes stay available between app launches.

 ## Planned Enhancements

 - **CRUD support**  
   - Remove quotes from a book  
   - Delete entire books  
   - Edit book titles / quote text  

 - **Database integration**  
   - Persistent storage in the cloud (MongoDB backend)  
   - Login system for backup + sync across devices  

 - **UI/UX improvements**  
   - Autocorrect + autocomplete book titles  
   - Take photo of book covers  
   - OCR (photo â†’ text quotes)  
   - Search between books (card layout with covers)  
   - Highlight punch lines in color  
   - Fun, engaging UI (not just utility)  
   - Smart redirect to *Not Found* screen if data is missing/invalid
