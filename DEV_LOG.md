---

## üé® Design Philosophy: iOS Look & Feel

### Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)
- Clean, minimal interface with focus on content
- Swipe-to-delete gestures for iOS-native feel
- Safe area support for modern iPhone notches
- Consistent touch targets and spacing

### Design System (theme.ts)
- Centralized typography scale
- Color palette for light/dark mode
- 8pt spacing rhythm for visual consistency
- Semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, text, background)

### Dark/Light Mode
- Automatic theme switching based on system preferences
- Carefully chosen colors for readability in both modes
- Smooth transitions between themes

---

## üíæ Data Persistence Journey

### Phase 1: AsyncStorage (Initial Implementation)
- Used AsyncStorage for simple key-value storage
- Implemented custom `storeObject` / `getObject` helpers
- Created `useBookQuotes` hook for state management

**Early Bug:** Quotes vanishing after reload
- **Root Cause:** Books weren't being properly serialized
- **Fix:** Refactored data structure and storage helpers

### Phase 2: Unique ID System
- Introduced `uniqueId()` helper to generate consistent IDs
- Prevented duplicate entries and React key warnings
- Added migration logic to retroactively assign IDs to existing data

### Phase 3: SQLite Migration (October 16, 2025)
**Why migrate?**
- Better performance for growing datasets
- Proper relational structure (books ‚Üí quotes)
- Support for complex queries and filtering
- Foundation for future search features

**Migration Process:**
- Implemented database schema with books and quotes tables
- Created `database.ts` utility with CRUD operations
- Added migration script to transfer AsyncStorage data to SQLite
- Maintained backwards compatibility during transition

**Database Schema:**
```sql
    IF NOT EXISTS books (
      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
      userId TEXT NOT NULL,
      title TEXT NOT NULL,
      coverUri TEXT
    );

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quotes (
      id TEXT PRIMARY KEYCREATE TABLE  NOT NULL,
      bookId TEXT NOT NULL,
      text TEXT NOT NULL,
      FOREIGN KEY (bookId) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    );

```

## üì∏ Camera Integration

### Book Cover Photos
- Used `expo-image-picker` for camera access
- Permission handling for iOS camera and photo library
- Image URI storage in SQLite
- Optimized image display with proper aspect ratios

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Permission Flow:** Handling denied permissions gracefully
2. **Image Quality:** Balancing quality vs storage size
3. **URI Management:** Persisting and loading image URIs correctly

---

## üîç OCR Implementation Journey

### Attempt 1: Native OCR (October 14, 2025) ‚ùå

**Goal:** On-device OCR for privacy and offline functionality

**Approach:**
- Added `expo-text-recognition` library
- Created `media.ts` utility for image handling
- Attempted full native build with `expo prebuild`

**Challenges:**
- Required leaving managed Expo workflow
- CocoaPods installation issues
- Xcode simulator registration errors
- `xcodebuild error 70` repeatedly
- Complex native environment dependencies

**Decision:** Abandoned native OCR
- Too complex for managed Expo workflow
- Developer experience suffered significantly
- Maintenance burden too high
- Prioritized app stability over this feature

**Reflection:** Sometimes the "right" technical solution isn't worth the complexity cost. Staying in managed Expo preserved velocity and simplicity.

---

### Attempt 2: Cloud OCR with Crop Feature (October 15, 2025) ‚ùå

**Goal:** Cloud-based OCR as a simpler alternative

**Approach:**
- Implemented Google Cloud Vision API via Cloud Function
- Used `expo-image-picker` with built-in cropping
- Base64 image encoding for API transmission

**Critical Issues:**

1. **Native Cropping Failure:**
   - `expo-image-picker`'s crop feature unreliable
   - Forced 1:1 aspect ratio despite requesting 16:3
   - Couldn't isolate single lines of text effectively

2. **Platform Feature Recognition:**
   - Realized iOS Live Text already provides superior OCR
   - Native features are faster, more accurate, and better UX
   - Building custom OCR became redundant

**Decision:** Removed dedicated OCR, recommended Live Text
- Simplified UI to basic text input
- Added hint to use native phone features
- Preserved code on `feature/cloud-ocr` branch

**Git Strategy:** Feature branch isolation allowed clean main branch while preserving working implementation for future reference.

---

### Attempt 3: Simplified Cloud OCR (October 17, 2025) ‚úÖ

**Goal:** Reintegrate OCR without cropping complexity

**Implementation:**

#### Cloud Function Setup
- Created `/cloud-function/` directory
- Deployed `vision-ocr-function.js` to Google Cloud Functions
- Handles POST requests with base64 images
- Returns extracted text via JSON response
- Added `.gcloudignore` for deployment optimization

#### App Integration
**File: `useBookInput.ts`**
- Created `handleOcrFromImage()` method
- Workflow:
  1. Request camera permissions
  2. Launch camera via `expo-image-picker`
  3. Convert image to base64 using `expo-file-system`
  4. POST to Cloud Function endpoint
  5. Parse response and populate quote field

**File: `BookInputForm.tsx`**
- Added camera icon next to quote input
- Visual consistency with book cover camera icon
- Clean, minimal UI without hint text

#### Error Handling
- Console logging at each workflow step
- User alerts for permission denials
- Network error handling with fallback
- Deprecated API method updates

#### Testing
- Verified on physical iPhone via Expo Go
- Tested with printed book quotes
- Confirmed text extraction accuracy
- Performance acceptable for user experience

**Success Factors:**
- Removed cropping requirement (accept full image)
- Cloud Function handles text extraction complexity
- Stayed within managed Expo workflow
- Simple, reliable user flow

## üß™ Testing Implementation (October 20, 2025)

### Setting Up Jest with Expo

**Goal:** Add unit tests for custom hooks to demonstrate testing proficiency

**Initial Challenge: Dependency Conflicts**
- React 19.1.0 vs react-test-renderer 19.2.0 mismatch
- `@testing-library/react-native` installation failed with ERESOLVE errors
- Standard `npm install` blocked by peer dependency checks

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react-native@13.3.3 --force
```
- Used `--force` flag to override peer dependency validation
- Testing library does support React 19+ (replaces deprecated react-test-renderer)
- Conflict was only about minor version differences

### Test Organization Strategy

**Decision:** Co-locate tests with source code
```
hooks/
  useBookQuotes.ts
  __tests__/
    useBookQuotes.test.ts
  useBookInput.ts
  __tests__/
    useBookInput.test.ts
```

**Benefits:**
- Tests live next to code they test
- Easier to maintain and find
- Jest auto-discovers `__tests__/` folders anywhere in project
- More organized than single root `__tests__/` directory

### Incremental Testing Approach

Built tests **one at a time** to avoid breaking the app:
1. ‚úÖ Install jest-expo + dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Add test script to package.json
3. ‚úÖ Configure Jest preset
4. ‚úÖ Install @testing-library/react-native (with --force)
5. ‚úÖ Write first simple test
6. ‚úÖ Add tests incrementally, verifying each passes

**Philosophy:** "Don't break the app" - test after each step

### Test Coverage

**useBookQuotes.ts (9 tests)**
- Database initialization
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Case-insensitive book title matching
- State updates after operations
- All database functions properly mocked

**useBookInput.ts (5 tests)**
- Form state management
- Input validation
- Save with trimmed whitespace
- Alert on missing fields
- State reset after save

**Total: 14 passing tests**

## üîê Multi-User Authentication & Data Isolation (October 21, 2025)

### Challenge: Shared Database Across Users
**Problem Discovered:** 
- SQLite database was device-local, not user-scoped
- All users on the same device saw the same books
- Switching accounts didn't change data
- Major privacy/data integrity issue

**Root Cause:**
- Books table lacked `userId` column
- Database queries didn't filter by user
- Original implementation assumed single-user device

**Changes Made:**
1. **database.ts**
   - Added `userId` parameter to all CRUD functions
   - `insertBook(id, userId, title, coverUri)`
   - `deleteBook(bookId, userId)` - only deletes if owned by user
   - `updateBookTitle(bookId, userId, newTitle)` - ownership validation
   - `getBooksWithQuotes(userId)` - filters results by user
   - Added `resetDatabase()` helper for schema migration

2. **useBookQuotes.ts**
   - Integrated `useAuth()` hook to get current user
   - Extracted `userId` from `user?.uid`
   - Passed `userId` to all database operations
   - Added `userId` to `useEffect` dependency for user switching

3. **AuthContext.tsx**
   - Enhanced with `resetPassword()` function
   - Email validation and trimming
   - User-friendly error messages for Firebase auth codes
   - Password reset via Firebase email workflow

4. **login.tsx**
   - Added "Forgot Password?" button (Sign In screen only)
   - Email/password validation before submission
   - Clear error messages for auth failures

### Lessons Learned

1. **Schema Changes Are Hard**
   - SQLite doesn't auto-migrate existing databases
   - Always plan for schema evolution from day one
   - Migration strategies needed for production apps

2. **Expo Go Limitations**
   - Can't easily clear app data like native apps
   - Database persists across code changes
   - Need explicit reset mechanisms for development

3. **User Context Is Critical**
   - Multi-user support should be designed in from start
   - Retrofitting user isolation is complex
   - `userId` foreign keys prevent unauthorized access

4. **Firebase Auth Benefits**
   - Handles password hashing, security
   - Built-in email verification
   - Password reset flows out of the box
   - Focus on app logic, not auth infrastructure

### Future Improvements

- [ ] OAuth providers (Google, Apple Sign-In)

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Multi-user support complete and tested  
**Breaking Change:** Requires database reset for existing users

## üîö Reflection

This project taught me that **constraints breed creativity**. Staying in managed Expo forced simpler solutions. Failed OCR attempts taught valuable lessons about when to use platform features vs building custom. The journey from AsyncStorage to SQLite showed how MVPs should evolve.

Most importantly: **the best feature is the one that makes users engage more deeply with what matters** - in this case, reading. The app isn't just about storing quotes; it's about noticing them in the first place.

Building MarkItDown reinforced that technology should enhance human experiences, not replace them.
