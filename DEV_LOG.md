## üé® Design Philosophy: iOS Look & Feel

### Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)
- Clean, minimal interface with focus on content
- Swipe-to-delete gestures for iOS-native feel
- Safe area support for modern iPhone notches
- Consistent touch targets and spacing

### Design System (theme.ts)
- Centralized typography scale
- Color palette for light/dark mode
- 8pt spacing rhythm for visual consistency
- Semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, text, background)

### Dark/Light Mode
- Automatic theme switching based on system preferences
- Carefully chosen colors for readability in both modes
- Smooth transitions between themes

---

## üíæ Data Persistence Journey

### Phase 1: AsyncStorage (Initial Implementation)
- Used AsyncStorage for simple key-value storage
- Implemented custom `storeObject` / `getObject` helpers
- Created `useBookQuotes` hook for state management

**Early Bug:** Quotes vanishing after reload
- **Root Cause:** Books weren't being properly serialized
- **Fix:** Refactored data structure and storage helpers

### Phase 2: Unique ID System
- Introduced `uniqueId()` helper to generate consistent IDs
- Prevented duplicate entries and React key warnings
- Added migration logic to retroactively assign IDs to existing data

### Phase 3: SQLite Migration (October 16, 2025)
**Why migrate?**
- Better performance for growing datasets
- Proper relational structure (books ‚Üí quotes)
- Support for complex queries and filtering
- Foundation for future search features

**Migration Process:**
- Implemented database schema with books and quotes tables
- Created `database.ts` utility with CRUD operations
- Added migration script to transfer AsyncStorage data to SQLite
- Maintained backwards compatibility during transition

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  author TEXT NOT NULL,
  coverUri TEXT,
  createdAt INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE quotes (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  bookId TEXT NOT NULL,
  text TEXT NOT NULL,
  note TEXT,
  createdAt INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (bookId) REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## üì∏ Camera Integration

### Book Cover Photos
- Used `expo-image-picker` for camera access
- Permission handling for iOS camera and photo library
- Image URI storage in SQLite
- Optimized image display with proper aspect ratios

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Permission Flow:** Handling denied permissions gracefully
2. **Image Quality:** Balancing quality vs storage size
3. **URI Management:** Persisting and loading image URIs correctly

---

## üîç OCR Implementation Journey

### Attempt 1: Native OCR (October 14, 2025) ‚ùå

**Goal:** On-device OCR for privacy and offline functionality

**Approach:**
- Added `expo-text-recognition` library
- Created `media.ts` utility for image handling
- Attempted full native build with `expo prebuild`

**Challenges:**
- Required leaving managed Expo workflow
- CocoaPods installation issues
- Xcode simulator registration errors
- `xcodebuild error 70` repeatedly
- Complex native environment dependencies

**Decision:** Abandoned native OCR
- Too complex for managed Expo workflow
- Developer experience suffered significantly
- Maintenance burden too high
- Prioritized app stability over this feature

**Reflection:** Sometimes the "right" technical solution isn't worth the complexity cost. Staying in managed Expo preserved velocity and simplicity.

---

### Attempt 2: Cloud OCR with Crop Feature (October 15, 2025) ‚ùå

**Goal:** Cloud-based OCR as a simpler alternative

**Approach:**
- Implemented Google Cloud Vision API via Cloud Function
- Used `expo-image-picker` with built-in cropping
- Base64 image encoding for API transmission

**Critical Issues:**

1. **Native Cropping Failure:**
   - `expo-image-picker`'s crop feature unreliable
   - Forced 1:1 aspect ratio despite requesting 16:3
   - Couldn't isolate single lines of text effectively

2. **Platform Feature Recognition:**
   - Realized iOS Live Text already provides superior OCR
   - Native features are faster, more accurate, and better UX
   - Building custom OCR became redundant

**Decision:** Removed dedicated OCR, recommended Live Text
- Simplified UI to basic text input
- Added hint to use native phone features
- Preserved code on `feature/cloud-ocr` branch

**Git Strategy:** Feature branch isolation allowed clean main branch while preserving working implementation for future reference.

---

### Attempt 3: Simplified Cloud OCR (October 17, 2025) ‚úÖ

**Goal:** Reintegrate OCR without cropping complexity

**Implementation:**

#### Cloud Function Setup
- Created `/cloud-function/` directory
- Deployed `vision-ocr-function.js` to Google Cloud Functions
- Handles POST requests with base64 images
- Returns extracted text via JSON response
- Added `.gcloudignore` for deployment optimization

#### App Integration
**File: `useBookInput.ts`**
- Created `handleOcrFromImage()` method
- Workflow:
  1. Request camera permissions
  2. Launch camera via `expo-image-picker`
  3. Convert image to base64 using `expo-file-system`
  4. POST to Cloud Function endpoint
  5. Parse response and populate quote field

**File: `BookInputForm.tsx`**
- Added camera icon next to quote input
- Visual consistency with book cover camera icon
- Clean, minimal UI without hint text

#### Error Handling
- Console logging at each workflow step
- User alerts for permission denials
- Network error handling with fallback
- Deprecated API method updates

#### Testing
- Verified on physical iPhone via Expo Go
- Tested with printed book quotes
- Confirmed text extraction accuracy
- Performance acceptable for user experience

**Success Factors:**
- Removed cropping requirement (accept full image)
- Cloud Function handles text extraction complexity
- Stayed within managed Expo workflow
- Simple, reliable user flow

## üéØ Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

### Why Managed Expo?
**Decision:** Stay in managed workflow, avoid ejecting

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ùå Limited to Expo SDK features
- ‚ùå Can't use some native libraries
- ‚úÖ Simpler deployment
- ‚úÖ OTA updates
- ‚úÖ Better developer experience
- ‚úÖ Easier maintenance

**Reflection:** For a learning project and MVP, managed Expo was the right choice. Native features can be added later if needed.

### Why Cloud OCR vs Native?
**Decision:** Use Google Cloud Vision API instead of on-device ML

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ùå Requires internet connection
- ‚ùå Privacy concerns (image sent to cloud)
- ‚ùå API costs (though minimal for personal use)
- ‚úÖ Works in managed Expo
- ‚úÖ No complex ML model management
- ‚úÖ High accuracy
- ‚úÖ Simple implementation

**Reflection:** For an MVP, cloud OCR struck the right balance between functionality and complexity.

### Why SQLite vs AsyncStorage?
**Decision:** Migrate from AsyncStorage to SQLite

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ùå More setup complexity
- ‚ùå Migration script required
- ‚úÖ Better performance at scale
- ‚úÖ Proper relational data
- ‚úÖ Complex queries possible
- ‚úÖ Foundation for search/filter

**Reflection:** Worth the migration effort for future features and better data modeling.

## üîö Reflection

This project taught me that **constraints breed creativity**. Staying in managed Expo forced simpler solutions. Failed OCR attempts taught valuable lessons about when to use platform features vs building custom. The journey from AsyncStorage to SQLite showed how MVPs should evolve.

Most importantly: **the best feature is the one that makes users engage more deeply with what matters** - in this case, reading. The app isn't just about storing quotes; it's about noticing them in the first place.

Building MarkItDown reinforced that technology should enhance human experiences, not replace them. Sometimes the best technical solution is the one that gets out of the way.
