# Welcome to my Book Quotes app

A simple React Native + Expo app for iOS that lets you log your favorite books and quotes.
Built with a focus on simplicity, modularity, and a user-friendly interface.

# Current Features (MVP)

- Add books with multiple quotes
- Prevent duplicate book entries (quotes are grouped by book)
- Automatic saving with AsyncStorage (local device storage)
- Custom Not Found screen with Safe Area support
- iOS dark/light mode support
- Organized project structure with Expo Router

# Planned Enhancements:

This project is just getting started! Here are the future features Iâ€™d like to add:
- Autocorrect for input fields
- Take a photo of the book cover
- Photo-to-text for quotes (OCR: take a photo of a quote and convert it to text)
- Search between books in a creative way (e.g. card layout with book titles & photos)
- Highlight punch lines in color for emphasis
- Login system (so users can back up and sync their data)
- Persistent storage in the cloud (beyond local temp storage)
- Autocomplete book titles if they already exist
- Fun and engaging UI/UX, not just utility
- Smart redirect to Not Found screen if data is missing or invalid

## Get started:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a
